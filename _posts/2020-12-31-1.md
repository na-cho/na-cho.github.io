Hello! You have found my comic strip, **Blobby**!

This started as an assignment for a health class, but then became something much bigger. 

Every comic is made using Google Drawings to preserve the childish and unprofessional look.

To find the most recent comic, either join the Discord server or click the Blobby tab at the top right again. 

Unfortunately, I'm not able to crank out a new comic every day as per the moment, so the upload schedule is very inconsistent. 

Here is the very first comic, dated July 23rd, 2020.
