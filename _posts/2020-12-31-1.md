title: "Blobby and his Pickled Shrooms"
---
Hello! You have found my comic strip, **Blobby**!<br><br>This started as an assignment for a health class, but then became something much bigger.<br><br>Every comic is made using Google Drawings to preserve the childish and unprofessional look.<br><br>To find the most recent comic, either join the Discord server or click the Blobby tab at the top right again.<br><br>Unfortunately, I'm not able to crank out a new comic every day as per the moment, so the upload schedule is very inconsistent.<br><br>Here is the very first comic, dated July 23rd, 2020.<br><br>
