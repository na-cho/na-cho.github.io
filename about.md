Hi! I'm Nathan Cho, Montgomery Blair High School Class of 2023 student. 

I participate in math competitions. I am also a violinist, math tutor, problem writer, cuber, programmer, and comic artist.

Currently, I am an advisor of [CNCM](https://cncmath.org/), and I frequent the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/hdHrT4dT9r).
