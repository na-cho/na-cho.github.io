There's that thing that they think whenever they touch my computer: ",day yd. ugjtZ" 

Or at least, that's what my keyboard thinks they think, because it's configured to use the Dvorak keyboard layout (as opposed to QWERTY). Why? Well, I think it's a hell of a lot better than QWERTY: same finger combinations are mostly avoided, home row has actually useful keys, and finger travel is much lower. Yet virtually every physical keyboard comes with QWERTY legends printed on the keys, with the indicators on the f and j keys. 

And on those physical keyboards almost always comes the caps lock key. Before 2019, I only touched the caps lock key accidentally when reaching for shift, and every time I did, I cursed its existence. Now, I use it on a daily basis, because I remapped it to backtick (`), which is way more useful for me. 

In order to remap it, I had to download Karabiner-elements to my MacBook Pro and deal with that hassle. But, it was worth it in my opinion. 

Why is backtick useful for me? Well, it's extremely convenient in Vim, the text editor I use. It allows me to write things like "`w" and have it automatically change it into "\omega" for LaTeX. But not everyone uses Vim, or LaTeX, or even backtick. 

Maybe that's not the option for everyone. However, I believe that most people could benefit from using the caps lock key as some other key, whether it be some other modifier or some custom macro.

Many people I talk to think I'm an idiot. Or that I'm *eccentric*, or some other flowery word that basically calls me out for being weird for wanting my computer to act differently than it was made to. I've heard many nonstatements like "if it works, it works," or "it does what it's supposed to do." 

I guess the idea is that computers were hard to work with at the time of introduction, so they had to become more standardized and preconfigured for a non-computer nerd, which I totally understand. The only thing is, this out-of-the-box experience is getting out of hand: now, it's more like the computer tells you how to use it. Instead, I think the user should be able to easily tell the computer what to do and when (wait, that's basically Linux...)

Or, Google Docs could add Vim-like functionality. I'm not picky. Just pissed off that Ctrl+w keeps on closing the damn tab instead of deleting a word.
