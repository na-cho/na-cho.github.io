If you have any specific handout request, message me on Discord (if you don't have my Discord, then you can join CNCM to find me).

### [States in Combinatorics](/files/states.pdf)
This handout was created to address the need of a free and useful resource for learning the method of event states. Prior to this handout, the only thorough and useful resource was AoPS Intermediate Combinatorics, which isn't cheap and also may be too broad for a focused mathematician.

### [Angle Trisection](/files/trisection.pdf)
These are my notes for a lecture I presented for the last Montgomery Blair Math Team meeting. It's not meant to be instructive, but more just some really cool geometry presented by a really enthusiastic person. I found this topic to be fascinating, and I hope you do too.


### [Game Theory: Nim](/files/nim.pdf)
Another MBHS Math Team lecture. I got super lazy, so a lot of details are missing and there aren't many problems. Definitely inspired from my time at Canada/USA Mathcamp. TL;DR everything is Nim. 

### Isogonal Conjugation and Circumconics
Also known as *Triangles, Hyperbolas, Isogonal Conjugates and Certain Circles,* these class notes and problem sets were for a Week 5 class at [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://mathcamp.org/) 2023, which I co-taught with [Anthony Wang](https://cosmicgenius.github.io/). 

Day 1 [notes](/files/THICCC/hyperbola_day_1.pdf) and [problem set](/files/THICCC/hw_day_1.pdf)
Day 2 [notes](/files/THICCC/hyperbola_day_2.pdf) and [problem set](/files/THICCC/hw_day_2.pdf)
