### Olyver
Olyver was a project to make International Math Olympiad Shortlist problems easily accessible via a discord bot. Though I no longer work on developing Olyver, it still is running on free Heroku hours. 

### Blobby Comics
I (try to) regularly update my comic strip, Blobby, which stemmed from a online Health course by accident. You can read my comics [on my site](https://https://na-cho.github.io/blobby/), or as soon as I draw them in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eQqQsGEcDz).
