Hi! I'm Nathan Cho (aka Nacho), Montgomery Blair High School Class of 2023 student. 

I am a:
 - violinist,
 - math tutor,
 - problem writer,
 - cuber,
 - first aid practitioner, 
 - amateur programmer, and
 - comic artist.

If you know where to find me, I'm always willing to talk about any of the above!
