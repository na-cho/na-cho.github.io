<h3 id="states-in-combinatorics"><a href="https://na-cho.github.io/files/states.pdf">States in Combinatorics</a></h3>
<p>This handout was created to address the need of a free and useful resource for learning the method of event states. Prior to this handout, the only thorough and useful resource was AoPS Intermediate Combinatorics, which isnâ€™t cheap and also may be too broad for a focused mathematician.</p>

<h3 id="angle-trisection"><a href="https://na-cho.github.io/files/trisection.pdf">Angle Trisection</a></h3>
<p>These are my notes for a lecture I presented for the last Montgomery Blair Math Team meeting. Itâ€™s not meant to be instructive, but more just some really cool geometry presented by a really enthusiastic person. I found this topic to be fascinating, and I hope you do too.</p>

<h3 id="game-theory-nim"><a href="https://na-cho.github.io/files/nim.pdf">Game Theory: Nim</a></h3>
<p>Another MBHS Math Team lecture. I got super lazy, so a lot of details are missing and there arenâ€™t many problems. Definitely inspired from my time at Canada/USA Mathcamp. TL;DR everything is Nim.</p>
