I"˜<p>The following is adapted from my AoPS Blog.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t understand any terminology here, itâ€™s probably in <a href="https://na-cho.github.io/files/nim.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>: Let us define a <em>dadjoke</em> to be a turn in which a person responds to a string of letters \(a\) containing the substring â€œimâ€, where spaces, punctuation, and capitalization are ignored by choosing an occurence of â€œimâ€ in \(a\), and then removing everything before the occurrence and then concatenating the resulting string to the string â€œhiâ€.</p>

<p>Example: A dadjoke on the string â€œI might cryâ€ would be â€œhi ight cryâ€. Spaces are included in the response for readability.</p>

<p>Now, suppose two people, named A and B, are conversing in an isolated universe. Person B tells person A a string, and then they take turns dadjoking the string, starting with player A, until a player cannot dadjoke anymore, in which case the last person to make a dadjoke wins the battle of wits.</p>

<p>Example: With an initial string of â€œIâ€™m imitating youâ€</p>

<p>Player A: â€œHi imitating youâ€</p>

<p>Player B: â€œHi itating youâ€</p>

<p>Player A: â€œDarn.â€ (Player B wins and Player A is sad)</p>

<p>Note that this game is guaranteed to be impartial:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of occurrences of the character â€œmâ€ must be strictly decreasing with every dadjoke</li>
  <li>The rest of the requirements are quite obvious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, by Sprague-Grundy, the dadjoke is isomorphic to Nim. But we can do a bit better than that.</p>

<p>The obvious observation here is that any character that is not an â€œiâ€ or â€œmâ€ does not matter, except for separation of these special characters. Furthermore, any occurence of â€œximxâ€ where â€œxâ€ represents non special characters, can be interpreted as a â€œsingle stoneâ€ on a larger pile.</p>

<p>Example: Consider the string â€œNim is cool, Iâ€™m simply minimally interested.â€ Note that this is directly isomorphic to a game of single pile nim with 4 rocks on the pile.</p>

<p>The issue occurs when we have a string like â€œximmxâ€, where one â€œmâ€ is dadjokable but the other is not (at least, not directly).</p>

<p>It is well known that normal single pile nim is a N game as long as there are a nonzero number of objects in the pile. We can interpret this as dadjoking the last â€œimâ€ in the string.</p>

<p>Let a string in the form â€œimm..mmâ€ be a \(n\)-block, where \(n\) is the number of adjacent â€œmâ€s. For instance, â€œim immatureâ€ has a 1-block and a 2-block.</p>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> A conversation is a \(P\) game (first person who dadjokes loses) iff there are no odd blocks in the string.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
If all blocks are even, then the â€œstrategy stealingâ€ argument works: dadjoking on a certain \(n\)-block where \(n\) is even gives the next player a \(n-1\) block and a bunch of even blocks, where then they can make it a \(n-2\) block and even blocks, and now all blocks are even once more. This guarantees that the second player always has a valid move, no matter what the first player dadjokes.</p>

<p>If there exists an odd block, then take the last odd block, and dadjoke it: now itâ€™s an even block, followed by only even blocks, which by earlier means that the second player cannot win.</p>
