<p>Olyver was a project to make International Math Olympiad Shortlist problems easily accessible via a discord bot. Though I no longer work on developing Olyver, it still is running on free Heroku hours.</p>

<h3 id="blobby-comics">Blobby Comics</h3>
<p>I (try to) regularly update my comic strip, Blobby, which stemmed from a online Health course by accident. You can read my comics <a href="https://https://na-cho.github.io/blobby/">on my site</a>, or as soon as I draw them in the <a href="https://discord.gg/eQqQsGEcDz">Discord server</a>.</p>
